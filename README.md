This was part of a programming challenge to build a landing page for a fictional company. The goal was to build out a project from scratch based on a starting image.
A REST API was used to generate the "How It Works" section.

## Next Steps (as of 4/10/2022)

1. Break up Steps component into subcomponents to make the page more readable and modular
